- 👋 Hi, I’m @GappleBee
- 👀 I’m interested in everything about computers, mainly the technical side though like programming, looking at computer parts, registry editing and BIOS editing (Not extracting and modding, just accessing and editing)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning more Python and little more C++ though basically everything I upload to GitHub is just going to be in Python.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on not much yet
- 📫 How to reach me: email: GappleBeeGitHub@gmail.com (account created specifically for GitHub Contact)
