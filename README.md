- 👋 Hi, I’m @GappleBee
- 👀 I’m interested in everything about computers, mainly the technical side though like programming, looking at computer parts, registry editing and BIOS editing (Not extracting and modding, just accessing and editing)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning more Python and little more C++
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on not much yet
- 📫 How to reach me: email irrationalmathematicspro71@gmail.com (Alternative account not registered on GitHub, also not my main account that I am currently using right now on GitHub)
